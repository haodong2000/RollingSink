💡 Some empirical tips:

Rolling Sink works more reliable given ***extrapolatable*** prompts:
- Prompts that describe a continuable shot (e.g., “a young woman riding a dark bay horse”) rather than a momentary event (e.g., “a bird landing on a wooden fence”).
- The semantic content generated in the first 5s (the training duration) has the potential to be ***faithfully extrapolated***$^1$ for ultra-long durations.

$^1$ The appearance or geometry of the subject (if any) shouldn't change significantly (such as Chevrolet Camaro to Bumblebee); and the layout of the background should remain stable.
